## Expertise

Well versed in design systems, front-end patterns, architectures, trends and
technologies. I gravitate towards statically typed ECMAScript and C based
languages. I've been working with Flux architectures in React and React Native
projects but I also enjoy native iOS and Android development. I've worked with
back-ends written in Ruby, Elixir, Go, Node.js and PHP. The last couple of
projects have relied on GraphQL coupled with Apollo on the client.

I have been a trusted advisor for C-level executives, entrepreneurs and
investors. I've refined processes and scaled organizations through growth and
contraction phases. I seek opportunities to create business value through
product development and mentorship of software engineering teams.

## Education

### Rochester Institute of Technology

Bachelor of Fine Arts
Interactive Media and Technology, Graphic Design. Go Tigers!
