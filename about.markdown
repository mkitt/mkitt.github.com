# About #
My name is **Matthew Kitt**. I architect and develop interfaces for web applications and systems. I work in a multitude of front-end technologies, focusing on the user experience and human interaction with software and hardware. I'm constantly exploring ways to find efficiencies in my work flow, process and how I approach day-to-day tasks. A good day of writing code is just about equal to first chair on a powder day.  
&nbsp;  
I'm currently employed at [Factory Design Labs](http://www.factorylabs.com/ "FDL") and have been there since 2005. My official title is UI Development Director. I'm responsible for the strategic architecture and development on marketing and application driven solutions, management and mentorship of the user interface development staff, oversight and development on framework and toolkit level code. At work we primarily develop in Ruby, ActionScript, JavaScript, Objective C and some legacy PHP. While we can't release specific client work, most of the code that powers what we build is available to fork over at [github](http://www.github.com/factorylabs "source code").
