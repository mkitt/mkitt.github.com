# About #
My name is **Matthew Kitt**. I architect and develop interfaces for web applications and systems. I work in a multitude of front-end technologies, focusing on the user experience and human interaction with software and hardware.  
&nbsp;  
I'm currently employed at [Factory Design Labs](http://www.factorylabs.com/ "FDL") and have been there since 2005. I'm responsible for the strategic architecture and development on marketing and application driven solutions, oversight and development on framework and toolkit level code, management and mentorship of the user interface development staff. While we can't release specific client work, most of the code that powers what we build is available to fork over at [github](http://www.github.com/factorylabs "work source code"). Additional career information lives on [linkedin](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/matthew-kitt/4/9b1/934 "resume style").

Otherwise feel free to send me a direct message via [twitter](http://www.twitter.com/matthewkitt "through the bird").
